# TitanPay
This app was built for an Intermediate Programming course using Python and sqlite database. The GUI uses Tkinter.  

To use the app:
1. Run "thegui"
2. Press "Import employees"
3. Press "Import timecards"
4. Press "Import receipts"
5. Press "Process payroll"

Once this is done, the app extracts timecard, receipt and hr data from the database, calculates the amount 
to be paid to each person and simulates delivery via multiple paths.
